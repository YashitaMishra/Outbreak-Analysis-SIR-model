# Outbreak-Analysis-SIR-model
I used the SIR model to compare spread of the covid outbreak between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations. This model was created as a DIY project for the course BIO-3636-1 during Summer 2025 at Ashoka University.
Instructions for running Python Script:
Make sure that you have the modules pandas and matplotlib.pyplot. 
You can check this by running the commands:

import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot 

If your terminal doesn’t display any error messages then run the code from the attached python script. 

If it shows an error message, run these lines in your terminal.

If pandas is not present use the following command:

pip install pandas

If matplotlib is not present, use the following command:

pip install matplotlib

The file output.png shows the plots that the code produces. For other values and rates of infections you can tweak the respective values and get plots accordingly. This model can be used for other datasets as well.
