This is the feedback I received on the initial submission of this code. I will be updating the code periodically to ensure that these issues are adressed.
1) Small set of data has been taken (200), which has been defined. However,a slightly larger set, like 500-700 could be used, since it's still quite small for research 
purposes but still give a better, randomized result.
2) Some improvements could include handling negative susceptible counts, smoothing noisy daily data.
3) the write up was lacking certain parameters and so did the presentation, making it difficukt to follow through and understand things perfectly.
4) The use of real world data was very nice to see. Perhaps checks for missing data could be added?
5) The integration of real-world data with theoretical epidemiological modeling makes the analysis both practical and academically valuable. However, using daily or 
active case counts instead of cumulative data could have provided a more accurate and directly comparable representation of the infection trends.
6) Improvement in parameter justification (e.g., β for unvaccinated not cited). Methodology is explained well, but the report could benefit from summarizing results in 
plain language (e.g., what the graphs show about the effectiveness of vaccination) rather than leaving all interpretation to the reader. Could enhance the model’s realism by
incorporating vaccination rates over time or expanding to SEIR/compartmental variations.
7) Could be explored more by integrating more models like Agent Based Modelling.
8) The main limitations lie in the way the "Susceptible" and "Infected" populations are calculated using daily new cases rather than active cases and in the reliance on hardcoded
parameter values, which reduce the model’s accuracy. The code also repeats calculations that could be streamlined.
